This is a generic Replicache backend built on Next.js and Supabase.

See https://doc.replicache.dev and
https://github.com/rocicorp/replicache-todo for example usage.

This isn't very extensible yet. We imagine over time and with experience, it will start to be clear what the extension points are. For now, if you'd like to add features to this the best way is probably to fork it.

PRs and feature requests are welcome!
